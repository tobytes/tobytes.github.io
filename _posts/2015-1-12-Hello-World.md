title: WTF are story points
published: true

At work we recently switched to [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)) as our development framework. In this process we decided to estimate our tasks with story points instead of hours.

Story points are a metric to measure the size of a task in comparison to other tasks. In contrast to hours they are not a fixed time frame but instead a relative measurement of work to do.

During our estimation meetings we argued a lot about what story points should resemble. Should it be complexity, efford or both?

Mike Cohn wrote in a [blogpost](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/its-effort-not-complexity), that story points should be more about effort but stated in a comment, that effort depends on complexity. In his [book](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Estimating-Planning-Mike-Cohn/dp/0131479415/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1403210360&sr=8-1&keywords=Agile+Estimating+and+Planning) "Agile Estimating and Planning" he wrote:
> A story-point estimate is an amalgamation of the amount of effort involved in developing the feature, the complexity of developing it, the risk inherent in it.

One user on a [stackexchange thread](http://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/2765/why-use-story-points-instead-of-hours-for-estimating) describes this as the three aspects of story points: complexity, effort and doubt.

**Complexity** represents the technical challenge to solve the task. You know what to do, but you have to figure out how.

**Effort** is the amount of work that needs to be done. You know how to do it, but it will take time.

**Doubt** is the unknown factor. There are things that aren't clear and have to be figured out.

All three aspects are intertwined and should be considered when you measure your tasks in story points.
